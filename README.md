# Deep-Learning-Image-Classification-using-CNN-and-Transfer-Learning
In this project, we build a CNN from scratch to classify CIFAR-10 images into categories. Next, we apply transfer learning using the pre-trained MobileNet model. Finally, we compare both models' performance through evaluation metrics and analysis to determine the more effective approach.
